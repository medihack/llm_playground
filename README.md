## How to use

- \# poetry install
- \# poetry shell
- \# inv download-mistral-7b
- View notebooks

## Results

- Llama.cpp with grammar (last example in notebook seems to work best)
- Outlines also ok but much slower
- lmql seems be too complicated (some strange Python like DSL)
- guidance is currently broken with latest llama python
